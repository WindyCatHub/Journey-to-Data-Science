Social networking is a powerful tool for freedom of speech. Sadly it doesn't check the intelligence of people writing their opinion. I got tired of comments like "Covid-19 is the same as the flu" or "It is nonsense to pay so much attention to Covid-19 when the death rate is 0.9%" or even the better "Using math I can say that it should be half of the country sick if there are 3000 people sick every day. And I do not know any of them."

People, please be data-driven before writing your comment under any article. I guess that person who wrote that the 0.9% mortality rate is meaningless did not calculate it by himself or did that incorrectly. If you would take the number of dead people from Covid-19 and divide it by all infected people in Lithuania then you would get 0.9%.

But this is not true as we do not know what will be the ending of people in treatment. So we should calculate the proportion in the set of recovered and dead people. Then we get 2%. And even if you want to write a comment that 2% is a small or large percent you need to know the total number. At the moment, there are more than 130 000 people who had or have Covid-19 in Lithuania.

After reading a lot of "smart and brainy opinion", I start thinking maybe I do not understand the whole situation in Lithuania regarding Covid-19. I compared 2019 and 2020 years of mortality data from the statistics department.

So firstly I tried to compare the reasons why people die. However I couldn't find this data for 2020, but I have it for 2019. If we would do hypothesis that 2019 and 2020 numbers are something around the same, we can take 2019 reasons with numbers and add Covid-19 data. In this situation, the picture would be like the one below.

For some, this graph shows that Covid-19 takes a big part in why people died. The other will say, that there are many more consequential illnesses. However, this is not the main reason why Covid-19 is so dangerous. The graph below shows death numbers each week in 2019 and 2020. I separated 2020 into two lines. One is total numbers each week while the other is deaths from other illnesses (then Covid-19). It was unexpected to me that it is such a 
significant difference between 2019 and 2020 data. We can see that week 31 is a point when the death numbers start increasing

So the biggest issue with the Covid-19 is that it can destroy the health care system for all the people. Furthermore, it is even harder to rebuild because it is hidden issues. 

Hopefully, people who know their rights will understand their duties as well. So that all of us could enjoy the life we were used to.
